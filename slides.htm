                    <br />
                    <span id="s3l2" class="line" data-section="slide3" data-type="narration" data-fragment-index="1" data-start="14.373" data-end="22.744" data-start-video="61.682" data-end-video="70.053">Many organizations are coming from using ASP.NET with either Web Forms or MVC, in which, moving to Blazor is a sensible choice.</span>

Blazor provides a web development standard that can be applied to mobile, web, or desktop applications.</span>

On the server-side, organizations have sacrificed performance to use node.js with JavaScript, instead of, a compiled, and very performant, .NET application written in C#. On the client-side, organizations would choose React, Angular, or Vue.js, because they were the best options a few years ago. For organizations that prefer the Microsoft Tech Stack, Blazor is now usually the best choice.</span>

No matter which codebase you are coming from, or evolving, software development teams should take an iterative approach and deliver updates frequently. I can help with all these aspects.</span>

This allows for 24/7 access to my 30+ years of experience that can be structured as coaching, training, small cohort, or consulting. It is like insurance for your software development team moving forward within the Microsoft Stack. For first-time clients, this is usually the best and safest choice.

The price for a Solution engagement is within six figures, and the target for deliverables usually begins after four weeks. The duration of the creating, implementing, and transferring the solution usually takes six to twelve months.</span>

I look forward to hearing from you. Also feel free to check out my YouTube channel, connect with me on LinkedIn, check out my GitHub repository, see my available presentations and workshops on Sessionize.com for conferences and meetups, go to MovingToBlazor.com to see more options, or go to MultimodalSlides.com to learn more about my side project that is also getting written in Blazor.</span>
